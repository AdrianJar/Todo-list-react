## 📖Description 

Hello everyone, I’d like to show you my "To do list" application.

So „To do list" is a web application which allows you to write down any tasks which are necessary (more or less), important (more or less)etc. This list can remind you what you had to do and after all you can simply mark them done or press one button to remove it from list. After update there are 2 more buttons which appear after task list has at least 1 task. First button marks all tasks done and second one hides done tasks.

My web applications contains of 4 buttons which are responsible for:

- ✅ button is responsible for marking tasks you’ve done by adding special text styles.
- 🗑️ button on red background is responsible for deleting tasks wether it was finished or you don’t want it to be there.
- "Ukryj ukończone" hides all tasks which are marked done.
- "Ukończ wszystkie" allows you to mark all tasks done by one click.
This web APP is a part of my Frontend Dev course in which I participate.

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
